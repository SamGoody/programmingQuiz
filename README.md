programmingQuiz
===============
The files for the quiz include:

programmingQuizTE.css
programmingQuizTE.php - contains the menu and the forms, 
programmingQuizTENavigation.php - a navigation class to access the db, 
programmingQuizTEAJAX.php - a file for the ajax, 
programmingQuizTE.js - javascript functions, 
programmingQuizTE - sql.txt

I estimated it would take me 2 hours to complete the quiz.
If I had more time I would add validation to the forms

The actual time it took me:
1) SQL - 15 minutes
2) HTML+CSS - 20 minutes
3-4) PHP, JS, and AJAX - 90 minutes
